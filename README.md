## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/DariaElagina/Test2/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
# Sara Teasdale
## (War Time)

**There will come soft rains** and the smell of the ground,
And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;

And frogs in the pools singing at night,
And wild plum trees in tremulous white,

_Robins will wear their feathery fire
Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;_

And not one will know of the war, not one
Will care at last when it is done.

Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree
If mankind perished utterly;

**And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,
Would scarcely know that we were gone**

### Markdown

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/DariaElagina/Test2/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
